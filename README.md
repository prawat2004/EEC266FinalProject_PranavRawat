How to Run the Code:

1. Make sure that the running environment has numPy and matplot lib. I used venv (virtual environment) and downloaded them on WSL Ubuntu, but I think any environment with these installed should work
2. Run python3 paper_implementation.py
3. The code should terminate after printing Finished! Image should be saved in same directory as Figure9&11.png
4. The resulting image should be saved to the current directory of wherever the code was run

Time to Run:
~30 seconds
